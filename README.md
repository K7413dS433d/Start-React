# Portfolio Template

## Overview

This project is my first portfolio template built with React. It serves as a simple and responsive personal portfolio that showcases essential pages such as Home, About, Portfolio, and Contact. It is designed using Flowbite React and Tailwind CSS for responsive components and styled UI, along with React Helmet for managing page titles.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The template is mobile-friendly and adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Main Pages**: Includes a Home, About, Portfolio, and Contact page.
- **Custom Page Titles**: Uses React Helmet to dynamically set the page titles (basic SEO).
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilizes Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, making it easier to manage design consistency.
- **Interactive Elements**: Buttons, forms, images and other interactive elements provided by Flowbite React.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend library used for building the UI.
